      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Project submissions must be in by <b> 11:30 AM</b>, but you can continue hacking until the expo at <b>1:30 PM</b>.
        At the expo, each team will present their projects for a few minutes at a time to small groups of judges in a science-fair format. After expo judging ends at <strong>2:00 PM</strong>, the top teams will be chosen to demo onstage during our closing ceremony in front of all of HackWCU!
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Juding Criteria</h2>
        
          <strong>Technical Difficulty</strong>
          Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on an API, or were there real technical challenges to surmount? This is the most important criterion that your hack will be judged upon for the general prizes.
          <br />
          <br />
        
          <strong>Originality</strong>
          Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app? Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?
          <br />
          <br />
        
          <strong>Polish</strong>
          Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?
          <br />
          <br />
        
          <strong>Usefulness</strong>
          Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfill a real need people have?
          <br />
          <br />
